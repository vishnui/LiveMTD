=======
An android application that presents users with a live Google Map with all the Champaign Urbana buses running at the moment.  All the current apps make you type in an intersection name or origin and destination and time but I just want to quickly see where the bus is right now.  So here it is.

Right now it updates every minute and shows all buses as the green.  Soon I will add the other colors as well so you can tell exactly which bus is which.  I'll also make it update more often.
