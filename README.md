LiveMTD
=======
An android application that presents users with a live Google Map with all the Champaign Urbana buses running at the moment.  Right now it updates every minute and shows all buses as the green.  Soon I will add the other colors as well so you can tell exactly which bus is which.  I'll also make it update more often.
