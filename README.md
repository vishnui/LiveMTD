An android application that presents users with a live Google Map with all the Champaign Urbana buses running at the moment.  All the current apps make you type in an intersection name or origin and destination and time but I just want to quickly see where the bus is right now.  So here it is.

Right now it updates every minute and is color coded so you can tell exactly which bus is which.  I'm currently working on stop information.  All the bus stops will be overlayed on the map and just click on them to see bus ETAs.
